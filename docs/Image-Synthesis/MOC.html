    <h2 id="hiz">HiZ</h2>
    <p>The Z buffer is splitted into serveral tiles and the HiZ(Hierarchical Z) buffer can be considered as an outline
        of a tile inside the Z buffer.</p>
    <p>The HiZ buffer consists of a &quot;z_tile_nearest&quot; value and a &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; value. And the
        &quot;z_tile_nearest&quot; is exactly the nearest Z value of the corresponding tile while the
        &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; may be equal or farther than the farthest Z value of the corresponding tile due to
        the fact that there is currently no efficient method to keep the &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; equal to the
        farthest Z value of the tile.</p>
    <p>The aim of the HiZ buffer is to skip the full z buffer test to improve the performance and there are three
        potential outcomes of the HiZ test: fail(&quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; nearer than &quot;z_tri_nearest&quot;),
        pass(&quot;z_tri_farthest&quot; nearer than &quot;z_tile_nearest&quot;) and ambiguous(neither fail or pass). It
        should be noted that the &quot;fail&quot; outcome is conservative since the &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; may be
        farther than the farthest Z value of the corresponding tile. Evidently, both &quot;fail&quot; and
        &quot;pass&quot; outcomes skip the full z buffer test and the ambiguous outcome should be decreased to improve
        the performance.</p>
    <p>And the &quot;z_tile_nearest&quot; can be efficiently updated as &quot;z_tile_nearest = nearest(z_tri_nearest,
        z_tile_nearest)&quot;. However, the &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; can only be efficiently updated as
        &quot;z_tile_farthest = nearest(z_tri_farthest, z_tile_farthest)&quot; when the outcome is &quot;pass&quot;
        since the &quot;z_tri_farthest&quot; and &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; may be not at the same sample of the Z
        buffer. And the slower &quot;delayed feedback update&quot;, which is to be removed by 1.[Andersson 2015], is
        currently required to update the &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot;.</p>
    <p>The main idea of &quot;1.[Andersson 2015]&quot; is to use the &quot;tile_mask&quot;(&quot;selection mask&quot;)
        to split the tile into two layers. Each layer has its own &quot;z_layer_farthest&quot; and the
        &quot;z_tile_farthest&quot; is replaced. And the HiZ test is performed based on the layer rather than the tile.
    </p>
    <p>Evidently, for a single sample, there is no &quot;ambiguous&quot; outcome, only &quot;pass&quot; or
        &quot;fail&quot;. A tile is considered as &quot;ambiguous&quot; only when it contains both the &quot;pass&quot;
        and &quot;fail&quot; samples. In my opinion, since the size of the layer is smaller than the tile, the potential
        that the layer contains both the &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;fail&quot; samples decreases and thus the
        &quot;ambiguous&quot; outcome is decreased.</p>
    <p>Besides, the &quot;tile_mask&quot; can be used to make sure that the &quot;z_tri_farthest&quot; and
        &quot;z_layer_farthest&quot; are at the same sample of the Z buffer, and thus the &quot;z_layer_farthest&quot;
        can be efficiently updated as &quot;z_layer_farthest = nearest(z_tri_nearest, z_layer_farthest)&quot; when the
        coverage mask of the triangle fully covers the mask of the layer. And in other cases, the
        &quot;z_layer_farthest&quot; is conservatively updated as &quot;z_layer_farthest = farthest(z_tri_nearest,
        z_layer_farthest)&quot;.</p>
    <p>And the underlying assumption of the &quot;two&quot; layers is that the same layer is expected to represent the
        same surface. For example, the Z buffer may represent a &quot;roof&quot; before the &quot;sky&quot;. And
        ideally, the &quot;tile_mask&quot; should make sure that one layer represents the &quot;roof&quot; and the other
        layer represents the &quot;sky&quot;.</p>
