## Introduction  

I am a mathematics amateur and I am learning the book "Visual Complex Analysis" in my leisure time.  

Since I am not professional, I am publishing my solutions here and I am willing to accept your criticism. If you find there are any mistakes or improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me by [email](mailto:HanetakaChou@outlook.com).  

## 1. Geometry and Complex Arithmetic  

III Some Applications / 4 Calculus  

Given a complex function Z(t) of a real variable t, we can visualize Z as the position of a moving particle, and $\displaystyle V = \frac{dZ}{dt}$ as the velocity.

By **The Law of Compound Motion**, the motion in vertical direction does not affect the motion in horizontal direction.

Thus, the vertical(imaginary) part and horizontal(real) part of the velocity V of Z can be simply calculated as the derivative of the vertical (imaginary) part and horizontal(real) part of the motion Z by **the differentiation rules of the real functions**.
