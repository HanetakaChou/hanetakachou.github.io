    <h1 dir="auto" id="memory-management">Memory Management</h1>
    <p dir="auto">There are two the GPU memory architectures: UMA and NUMA.<br>
        Desktop PC discrete GPUs are the typical cases of the NUMA architecture where the system memory can be accessed
        by both the GPU and CPU, while the dedicated video memory can be only accessed by the the GPU.<br>
        Desktop PC integrated GPUs, mobile GPUs and console (PlayStation and XBox) GPUs are the typical cases of the UMA
        architecture where the GPU and CPU share the same memory.</p>
    <h2 dir="auto" id="upload">Upload</h2>
    <h3 dir="auto" id="numa">NUMA</h3>
    <p dir="auto">For NUMA GPU, we need to first fill the <a
            href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/refs/heads/chromium/5777/src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/vk_helpers.cpp#4877">staging
            buffer</a> with the initial data, and then issue the GPU command to copy the data from the staging buffer to
        the destination buffer or image.</p>
    <h3 dir="auto" id="uma">UMA</h3>
    <p dir="auto">For UMA GPU, we can use the CPU to write initial data into the destination buffer or image
        directly.<br>
        This approach works trivially when we are writing into the buffer.<br>
        However, the tile mode (<strong>VkImageTiling</strong> in Vulkan, <strong>D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT</strong> in
        Direct3D12) should be considered when we are writing into the image.</p>
    <h4 dir="auto" id="tile-mode">Tile Mode</h4>
    <p dir="auto">The linear tile mode (<strong>VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR</strong> in Vulkan,
        <strong>D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_ROW_MAJOR</strong> in Direct3D12) is exactly the natural memory layout of the
        <strong>C++ 2D array</strong>. However, by &quot;A.4.4 Blocked 2D Arrays&quot; of <a
            href="https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Utilities/Memory_Management#Blocked2DArrays">PBRT-V3</a>, the linear
        tile mode is NOT efficient when the 2D texture is indexed by (u, v), since the adjacent locations in the v
        direction would be on different cache line.</p>
    <p dir="auto">The optimal tile mode (<strong>VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL</strong> in Vulkan,
        <strong>D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN</strong> in Direct3D12) is the efficient memory layout of which the
        implementation is vendor dependent.<br>
        By &quot;A.4.4 Blocked 2D Arrays&quot; of <a
            href="https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Utilities/Memory_Management#Blocked2DArrays">PBRT-V3</a>, the
        <strong>Blocked 2D Array</strong> can be one implementation.<br>
        <img src="Memory-Management-1.png" alt="" data-src="Memory-Management-1.png"><br>
        And by &quot;Figure 23.15&quot; of <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time Rendering Fourth
            Edition</a>, the <strong>Morton sequence</strong> can be one implementation.<br>
        <img src="Memory-Management-2.png" alt="" data-src="Memory-Management-2.png">
    </p>
    <p dir="auto">Since the image is usually in optimal tile mode for better performance, we can NOT simply copy the
        linear initial data into the image just like how we initialize the buffer.</p>
    <p dir="auto">We can use <strong>VK_EXT_host_image_copy</strong> in Vulkan or
        <strong>ID3D12Resource::WriteToSubresource</strong> in Direct3D12 to use the CPU to write initial data into the
        image directly. These two functions can convert the linear initial data into the optimal tiling mode of the
        image.</p>
    <p dir="auto">In console, an analog of the the AMD addrlib <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/radv_meta_bufimage.c#L1372">ac_surface_addr_from_coord</a>
        can be used.</p>
