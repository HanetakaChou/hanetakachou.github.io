    <h1 dir="auto" id="command-buffer">Command Buffer</h1>
    <h2 dir="auto" id="vulkan">Vulkan</h2>
    <p dir="auto">In Vulkan, the memory of the command buffer is managed by the driver. Usually, the application
        allocates &quot;frame_<a
            href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/graphics-gaming-and-vr-blog/posts/the-mali-gpu-an-abstract-machine-part-1---frame-pipelining">throttling</a>_count&quot;
        command pools in advance, and uses the &quot;frame_throttling_index&quot; to select the command pool from which
        the command buffers are allocated in each frame. Note that the &quot;frame_throttling_count&quot; should be
        distinguished from the &quot;swapchain_image_count&quot;.</p>
    <p dir="auto">For example, in <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html">RADV</a>, the memory is stored in
        the list <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/winsys/amdgpu/radv_amdgpu_cs.c#L482">radv_amdgpu_cs::handles</a>.
        Evidently, we can NOT know in advance how much memory we should allocate for the command buffer at the begining
        of each frame. Hence, when we are out of memory, we need to allocate a new buffer object and insert the new
        buffer object to the list (see <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/winsys/amdgpu/radv_amdgpu_cs.c#L409">cs_grow</a>,
        <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/radv_cmd_buffer.c#L466">radv_reset_cmd_buffer</a>,
        <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/radv_cmd_buffer.c#L546">radv_cmd_buffer_resize_upload_buf</a>
        and <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/amd/vulkan/winsys/amdgpu/radv_amdgpu_cs.c#L547">cs_add_buffer</a>
        for more information). Thus, the memory of the command buffer is NOT continuous, and is composed by several
        buffer objects in the list.
    </p>
    <p dir="auto">Particularly, the RADV follows the Mesa3D <a
            href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/22.3/src/vulkan/runtime/vk_command_pool.c#L131">common
            command pool framework</a> where the vkResetCommandPool is implemented by the vkResetCommandBuffer. This
        means that the memory of the command buffer is managed by the command buffer rather than the command pool in
        RADV.</p>
    <h2 dir="auto" id="console">Console</h2>
    <p dir="auto">In console, the memory of the command buffer is managed by the application rather than the driver.
        When the command buffer is initialized, a memory buffer can be provided by the application. And the application
        can also provide an out-of-memory callback, which is invoked when the command buffer is out of the memory.</p>
    <p dir="auto">Perhaps, it is too difficult for the application to manage the memory of the command buffer, the ring
        buffer class is provided to help the application. The ring buffer provides a function which can be used by the
        application as the out-of-memory callback of the command buffer, and the application does NOT need to provide
        the memory buffer any more when initializing the command buffer.</p>
    <p dir="auto">The ring buffer maintains a list of several segments, which is analogous to the list of the
        &quot;memory buffer objects&quot; in RADV, and the ring buffer inserts the &quot;jump&quot; commands to connect
        these separated segments. When the ring buffer is initialized, several segments can be added to the ring buffer
        by the application. And the application can also provide an out-of-memory callback, which is invoked when there
        are no free segments in the ring buffer. Note that the out-of-memory callback of the ring buffer should be
        distinguished from the out-of-memory callback of the command buffer.</p>
    <p dir="auto">By default, no out-of-memory callback is provided, and the ring buffer waits until the GPU has stopped
        using the submitted segments.</p>
    <p dir="auto">Actually, this default waiting behavior of the the ring buffer is analogous to the legacy <a
            href="https://developer.nvidia.com/content/constant-buffers-without-constant-pain-0">Direct3D11 constant
            buffer</a> which waits for the GPU when the constant buffer is out of memory. To improve the performance,
        the memory of the constant buffer is visible to the application in <a
            href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/api/dynamic_uniform_buffers">Vulkan</a>
        and <a
            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/fence-based-resource-management">Direct3D12</a>,
        and thus the more efficient strategy, which is NOT compatible with the Direct3D11 specification, can be adopted
        by the appilcation. For example, the application may simply ignore the subsequent objects when the constant
        buffer is out of memory, and thus the application does NOT need to wait any more.</p>
    <p dir="auto">Evidently, the out-of-memory callback of the ring buffer can be provided by the application to avoid
        the waiting. The application can allocate the memory for another new segment and add the new segment to the ring
        buffer in the out-of-memory callback of the ring buffer, and the application does NOT need to provide the
        segments any more when initializing the ring buffer. Optionally, the application may retrieve the free segments
        of the ring buffer and free the memory of the segments when resetting the command buffer. This is analogous to
        the behavior of &quot;radv_reset_cmd_buffer&quot; in RADV, but evidently we can keep using the existing segments
        without freeing them for better performance.</p>
