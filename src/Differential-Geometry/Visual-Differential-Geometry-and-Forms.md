## Introduction  

I am a mathematics amateur and I am learning the book "Visual Differential Geometry and Forms" in my leisure time.  

Since I am not professional, I am publishing my solutions here and I am willing to accept your criticism. If you find there are any mistakes or improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me by [email](mailto:HanetakaChou@outlook.com).  


## Prologue: Newtonian Ultimate Equality ( ≍ )

### 3-1  
The **ultimate equality** notation "≍" actually represents the **equivalent infinitesimal** which can be checked by the **Taylor's theorem**.  


## Act I: Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry

### 3-6

By (1.3), we have $\displaystyle \lim\limits_{\vartriangle_p \rightarrow 0} \operatorname{\varepsilon}(\vartriangle_p) = \lim\limits_{\vartriangle_p \rightarrow 0}\frac{\operatorname{A}(\vartriangle_p)}{R^2} = \frac{1}{R^2}\lim\limits_{\vartriangle_p \rightarrow 0}\operatorname{A}(\vartriangle_p) = \frac{1}{R^2} \times 0 = 0$.  

And since "ε ≡ (angle sum of triangle) − π", we have "(angle sum of triangle) − π = 0" and thus "(angle sum of triangle) = π".
