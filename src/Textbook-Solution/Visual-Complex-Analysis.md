## Introduction  

I am a mathematics amateur and I am learning the book "Visual Complex Analysis" in my leisure time.  

Since I am not professional, I am publishing my solutions here and I am willing to accept your criticism. If you find there are any mistakes or improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me by [email](mailto:HanetakaChou@outlook.com).
