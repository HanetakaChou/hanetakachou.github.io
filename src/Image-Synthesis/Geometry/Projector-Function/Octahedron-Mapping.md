# Octahedron Map  

Since the sphere is a 2-manifold rather than a 3-manifold, a bijection can be formed between the points on the sphere and the 2D texture coordinates.

## Applications  

### Point Light Shadow Mapping  

// TODO  

### Normal Representation  

// Real-Time Rendering Fourth Edition / 16.6 Compression and Precision  
// Evidently, a bijection can be formed between the unit vectors and the points on the sphere. And thus, the projector functions can be used to compress the normals to 2D coordinates.
