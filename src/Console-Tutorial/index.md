# Console Tutorial  

This tutorial is to introduce the usage of the console API. We assume that readers already have the knowledge of the modern API such as Vulkan or Direct3D12. And we will provide the analogous concepts from the Vulkan or Direct3D12 API to help readers comprehend the idea of the console API better. Besides, we provide a demo project **PAL-Cube** (only available for accredited developers) which is a Direct3D12 and console port of the original [Vkcube](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools/tree/main/cube) demo to help readers compare the usage of the console API with the Vulkan or Direct3D12 API.
